## Functions
### `print()`
```tsx
pewpew.print(str: string)
```
Prints `str` in the console for debugging.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local some_number = 42
> pewpew.print("the value of some_number is: " .. some_number)
> ```

---
### `print_debug_info()`
```tsx
pewpew.print_debug_info()
```
Prints debug info: the number of entities created and the amount of memory used by the script.

> Example:
> ```lua
> pewpew.print_debug_info()
> ```

---
### `set_level_size()`
```tsx
pewpew.set_level_size(
  width: FixedPoint,
  height: FixedPoint
)
```
Sets the level's size. Implicetely adds walls to make sure that entities can not go outside of the level's boundaries. `width` and `height` are clamped to the range ]0fx, 6000fx]. If this function is not called, the level size is (10fx, 10fx), which is uselessly small for most cases.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local width = 300fx
> local height = 200fx
> pewpew.set_level_size(width, height)
> ```

---
### `add_wall()`
```tsx
pewpew.add_wall(
  start_x: FixedPoint,
  start_y: FixedPoint,
  end_x: FixedPoint,
  end_y: FixedPoint
): int
```
Adds a wall to the level from (`start_x`,`start_y`) to (`end_x`,`end_y`), and returns its wall ID. A maximum of 200 walls can be added to a level.

> Example:
> ```lua
> pewpew.add_wall(100fx, 100fx, 200fx, 200fx)
> ```

---
### `remove_wall()`
```tsx
pewpew.remove_wall(wall_id: int)
```
Remove the wall with the given `wall_id`.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local wall_id = pewpew.add_wall(100fx, 100fx, 200fx, 200fx)
> -- Later, when the wall needs to be removed:
> pewpew.remove_wall(wall_id)
> ```

---
### `add_update_callback()`
```tsx
pewpew.add_update_callback(update_callback: function)
```
Adds a callback that will be updated at each game tick.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local tick_count = 0
> pewpew.add_update_callback(function()
>   pewpew.print("this is tick " .. tick_count)
>   tick_count = tick_count + 1
> end)
> ```

---
### `get_number_of_players()`
```tsx
pewpew.get_number_of_players(): int
```
Returns the number of players in the game.


---
### `increase_score_of_player()`
```tsx
pewpew.increase_score_of_player(
  player_index: int,
  delta: int
)
```
Increases the score of the player at the specified `player_index` by an amount of `delta`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. Note that `delta` can be negative.


---
### `increase_score_streak_of_player()`
```tsx
pewpew.increase_score_streak_of_player(
  player_index: int,
  delta: int
)
```
Increases the score streak counter of the player at the specified `player_index` by an amount of `delta`. This counter is used to determine at which level of score streak the player is at. In turn, the score streak level is used to determine how much pointonium is given. Typically the score streak counter should be increased when an enemy is destroyed with the same score that the enemy provide. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. Note that `delta` can be negative.


---
### `get_score_streak_level()`
```tsx
pewpew.get_score_streak_level(player_index: int): int
```
Returns a number between 0 and 3. 0 is the lowest score streak (no pointonium is given), while 3 is the highest (3 pointoniums is usually given)


---
### `stop_game()`
```tsx
pewpew.stop_game()
```
Ends the current game.


---
### `get_player_inputs()`
```tsx
pewpew.get_player_inputs(player_index: int): FixedPoint, FixedPoint, FixedPoint, FixedPoint
```
Returns the inputs of the player at the specified `index`. The return values are in order: the movement joystick's angle (between 0 and 2pi), the movement joystick's distance (between 0 and 1), the shoot joystick's angle (between 0 and 2pi), and the shoot joystick's distance (between 0 and 1).

> Example:
> ```lua
> local move_angle, move_distance, shoot_angle, shoot_distance = pewpew.get_player_inputs(0)
> ```

---
### `get_score_of_player()`
```tsx
pewpew.get_score_of_player(player_index: int): int
```
Returns the score of the player at the specified `player_index`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1].


---
### `configure_player()`
```tsx
pewpew.configure_player(
  player_index: int,
  configuration: table {
    has_lost: bool,

    camera_distance: FixedPoint,
    camera_rotation_x_axis: FixedPoint,
    move_joystick_color: int,
    shoot_joystick_color: int
  }
)
```
Configures the player at the specified `player_index`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. A `camera_distance` less than 0fx makes the camera move away from the ship. `camera_rotation_x_axis` is in radian and rotates along the X axis.
 To temporarily override the XY position of the camera, set **both** `camera_x_override` and `camera_y_override`; this will make the camera be interpolated from wherever it was, to that new position.

> Example:
> ```lua
> pewpew.configure_player(0, {shield = 3, camera_distance = 50fx, move_joystick_color = 0xffff00ff})
> ```

> Example:
> ```lua
> pewpew.configure_player_hud(0, {top_left_line = "Hello World"})
> ```

---
### `get_player_configuration()`
```tsx
pewpew.get_player_configuration(player_index: int): table {
    shield: int,
    has_lost: bool

  }
)
```
Configures the weapon of the ship identified with `ship_id` using `configuration`. `frequency` determines the frequency of the shots. `cannon` determines the type of cannon. `duration` determines the number of game ticks during which the weapon will be available. Once the duration expires, the weapon reverts to its permanent configuration. If `duration` is omitted, the weapon will be permanently set to this configuration. If `frequency` or `cannon` is omitted, the ship is configured to not have any weapon.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local weapon_config = {frequency = pewpew.CannonFrequency.FREQ_10, cannon = pewpew.CannonType.DOUBLE}
> local ship_id = player_helpers.new_player_ship(100fx, 200fx, 0)

  configuration: table {
    swap_inputs: bool
  }
)
```
Configures various properties of the player ship identified by`id`


---
### `add_damage_to_player_ship()`
```tsx
pewpew.add_damage_to_player_ship(
  ship_id: EntityId,

### `add_arrow_to_player_ship()`
```tsx
pewpew.add_arrow_to_player_ship(
  ship_id: EntityId,
  target_id: EntityId,
  color: int

```tsx
pewpew.set_player_ship_speed(
  ship_id: EntityId,
  factor: FixedPoint,
  offset: FixedPoint,
  duration: int
): FixedPoint
```
Sets and returns the **effective speed** of the specified player ship as a function of the **base speed** of the ship. By default, a player ship moves according to its base speed, which is 10 distance units per tick (in the future, different ships may have different base speeds). 
Assuming the base speed of the ship is S, the new effective speed will be `(factor*S)+offset`. `duration` is the number of ticks during which the effective speed will be applied. Afterwards, the ship's speed reverts to its base speed. If `duration` is negative, the effective speed never reverts to the base speed.

```tsx
pewpew.customizable_entity_set_visibility_radius(
  entity_id: EntityId,
  radius: FixedPoint
)
```
Sets the radius defining the visibility of the entity. This allows the game to know when an entity is actually visible, which in turns allows to massively optimize the rendering.

---
### `customizable_entity_configure_wall_collision()`
```tsx
pewpew.customizable_entity_configure_wall_collision(
  entity_id: EntityId,
  collide_with_walls: bool,
  collision_callback: function
)
```
`collide_with_walls` configures whether the entity should stop when colliding with walls. If `collision_callback` is not nil, it is called anytime a collision is detected. The callback gets called with the entity id of the entity withthe callback, and with the normal to the wall.

> Example:
> ```lua
> function my_wall_collision_callback(entity_id, wall_normal_x, wall_normal_y)
>   pewpew.print("A wall collision happened with entity " .. entity_id)

### `customizable_entity_set_player_collision_callback()`
```tsx
pewpew.customizable_entity_set_player_collision_callback(
  entity_id: EntityId,
  collision_callback: function
)
```
Sets the callback for when the customizable entity identified by `id` collides with a player's ship. The callback gets called with the entity id of the entity with the callback, and the player_index and ship_id that were involved in the collision. Don't forget to set a radius on the customizable entity, otherwise no collisions will be detected.

> Example:
> ```lua
> function my_collision_callback(entity_id, player_index, ship_entity_id)
>   pewpew.print("The entity: " .. entity_id)
>   pewpew.print("Collided with the ship: " .. ship_entity_id)
>   pewpew.print("That belongs to the player: " .. player_index)
> end
> local id = pewpew.new_customizable_entity(100fx, 100fx)

> ```

---
### `customizable_entity_set_weapon_collision_callback()`
```tsx
pewpew.customizable_entity_set_weapon_collision_callback(
  entity_id: EntityId,
  weapon_collision_callback: function
)

Sets the callback for when the customizable entity identified by `id` collides with a player's weapon. The callback gets called with the entity_id of the entity on which the callback is set, the player_index of the player that triggered the weapon, and the type of the weapon. The callback *must* return a boolean saying whether the entity reacts to the weapon. In the case of a bullet, this boolean determines whether the bullet should be destroyed.

> Example:
> ```lua
> local id = pewpew.new_customizable_entity(100fx, 100fx)
> pewpew.customizable_entity_set_weapon_collision_callback(id, function(entity_id, player_index, weapon_type)
>   pewpew.print("Collided with weapon from player: " .. player_index)
>   if weapon_type == pewpew.WeaponType.BULLET then
>     pewpew.print("Collided with bullet!")
>   end
>   return true
> end)
> ```
